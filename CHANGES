2011-05-06 - Version 0.3.9
  - Ecore::Auditing added. any node operation will be logged now
  - Ecore::Assets deprecated
  - Labels extended. This brings a major performance improvement.
    define in class Worker "has_labels :company" and in class Company "scope :worker" to cross-link a relational mapping like in ActiveRecord
    This gives you worker.add_company( company ) and company.workers.find(:id => worker.id), which will perform a cached lookup.

2011-05-03 - Version 0.3.8
  - NodeAsset bugfixed: not saving asset everytime a node is saved, if asset is unchanged. That caused assets
    to have a changed mtime attribute, if anything was updated
  - NodeAsset bugfixed: node.id is saved properly
  - NodeAsset node method added, so an asset can return it's associated node
  - User.everybody added
  
2011-04-28 - Version 0.3.7
  - Node::Asset added. An asset can be used, to fix other information to a node, which doesn't need to be
    found apart from within the node itself
  - fixed hooks, attributes and validations, which were omitting classes between current class and Ecore::Node class.
    it is now possible to subclass Ecore::Node as often as needed
  - Mutex verifies, that a node is not written at by two processes at once
  - Case insensitive searching
    
2011-04-27 - Version 0.3.6
  - groups are kept in user object, not in groups object, so it is faster to get groups of a user (which happens more often)

2011-04-26 - Version 0.3.5
  - caching for much faster queries is keeping cache with Ecore::ENV[:max_cache_size] || 100
  
2011-04-23 - Version 0.3.4
  - nokogiri stable did not succeed with libxml dependency in java.
    moved to nokogiri 1.5.0.beta.4. worked
  - bugfixes in acls and labels (fixing infinite loops)
    
2011-04-22 - Version 0.3.3
  - moved from libxml-ruby to nokogiri (due to java / jruby compatibility)
  - xml stores attributes as xml attributes now (Version 1.0 -> 1.1) in order to prepare changing queries from xpath to SAX-Parser querying method (much later)
  
MISSING UNTIL Version 1.0:
  - full journaling (versioning nodes)
  - auditing
